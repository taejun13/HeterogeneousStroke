-----------------

Have you ever imagined reading texts through your skin? Heterogeneous Stroke is a design concept that utilizes unique vibrations for each actuators to help users better recognize the tactile "stroke". Since a single tactile "stroke" consists of mutually distinctive (=heterogeneous) vibration stimuli, we decided to call this idea "Heterogeneous Stroke". This project was published in [CHI 2021](https://chi2021.acm.org/).
